BINARY FRAME

    Type sent is Uint8Array

    One message is composed of
    -   transfer ID byte 1
    -   transfer ID byte 2
    -   transfer ID byte 3
    -   transfer ID byte 4
    -   control byte
    -   sequence of bytes representing data

    The 4 transfer ID bytes are used to identify the file being transferred.

    The control byte is:
        0   if the current message is not the last chunk of data
        1   if the current message is the last chunk of data

SERVER SIDE

    There is an open set of files being transferred.

    When a message is received:

    -   if it's an unseen transfer ID, lookup in the database and create a Partial Transfer object

    -   if control byte is 0, reset the idle timeout of the Partial Transfer and append data

    -   if control byte is 1, append data and signal completion of transfer
